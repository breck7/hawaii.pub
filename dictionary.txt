waiian alphabet.

A (a), adj. Fiery; burning: he lua

tense, it signifies when, and when,
etc.: as, a hiki mai ia, when he

designation of place: as, mai a nei
aku, from here (this place) on-
ward. Until: as, noho oia malaila
a make; he lived there until he
died. (A nei is often written as
one word, and then it signifies
here, or the present place.)

A when pronounced with a pro-
tracted sound, signifies a pro-
tracted period of time, or dis-
tance, or a long continued action:
as, holo ae la ia a =E2=80=94 a hiki i ka

is usually joined with me; as,
haawi mai oia i ka ai a me ke
kapa, he furnished food and cloth-
ing. A with me signifies and, and
also, besides, together with, etc.
When emphatic, it is merely a dis-
junctive. In narration, it frequent-
ly stands at the beginning of sen-
tences or paragraphs, and merely
refers to what has been said, with-
out any very close connection with
it. In many cases it is apparently
euphonic or seems to answer no

i keia ala, before you have passed
this road.

Hoo (ho'o). Causative prefix to verbs;
as, malu, to shade, hoomalu, to
cause a shade, to over-shadow;
pono, good, right, hoopono, to cor-
rect, to make right; akea, to be
broad, hooakea or hoakea, to cause
to be broad, that is, to extend, en-
large, etc.

This prefix, though originally
adapted to the verb, retains its
causative meaning when the word
becomes a noun, adjective or ad-
verb. Ua hele oia i ka hoike, he
has gone to the exhibition; he
kanaka hoopunipuni, a man caus-
ing deception, that is, a deceitful
man; olelo hooino iho la, he spoke
causing reproach, that is, he
spoke reproachfully.

Before words whose first letter
is a vowel, the last o of the hoo
frequently coalesces with the vow-
el of the word following, for the
sake of euphony, particularly be-


fore a, e and o; as, hoano for
hooano; hoole for hooole, etc. Some
words have haa (but very seldom)
for their causative prefix instead
of hoo; as, haaheo for hooheo
(from heo, pride), to be haughty.
This form seems to come from
the Tahitiian dialect. A few
words take both forms for their
causative, as hoonui and haanui,
from nui, to be large. Hoawi, to
give, is used for hooawi, but haawi
is used oftener than either.

Strictly speaking, hoo in a dic-
tionary should not begin a verb,
but verbs having this prefix
should be set in their places, and
their meanings be modified by
hoo as it occurs; as, ike, to know,
etc hooike or hoike, to cause to
know, to show, to exhibit; ikeia,
to be known, hooikeia, to be made
known, to be shown; ikeike, to
know clearly; hooikeike, to make
known clearly or frequently, etc.
But a large class of words begin
with the causative prefix hoo,
whose roots are not known or are
out of use. Though such a root
might be assumed as being in ex-
istence or having once existed, as
Greek lexicographers often as-
sume an obsolete theme, there
would be much danger in Hawaii-
an of getting the wrong word:
hence it has seemed advisable to
retain hoo as the beginning of
the word. This occasions some
repetition, but it is hoped it will
not be a serious inconvenience.

This prefix always takes the

glottal sound.
